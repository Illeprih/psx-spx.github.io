#### 1F801070h I\_STAT - Interrupt status register (R=Status, W=Acknowledge)
#### 1F801074h I\_MASK - Interrupt mask register (R/W)
Status: Read I\_STAT (0=No IRQ, 1=IRQ)<br/>
Acknowledge: Write I\_STAT (0=Clear Bit, 1=No change)<br/>
Mask: Read/Write I\_MASK (0=Disabled, 1=Enabled)<br/>
```
  0     IRQ0 VBLANK (PAL=50Hz, NTSC=60Hz)
  1     IRQ1 GPU   Can be requested via GP0(1Fh) command (rarely used)
  2     IRQ2 CDROM
  3     IRQ3 DMA
  4     IRQ4 TMR0  Timer 0 aka Root Counter 0 (Sysclk or Dotclk)
  5     IRQ5 TMR1  Timer 1 aka Root Counter 1 (Sysclk or H-blank)
  6     IRQ6 TMR2  Timer 2 aka Root Counter 2 (Sysclk or Sysclk/8)
  7     IRQ7 Controller and Memory Card - Byte Received Interrupt
  8     IRQ8 SIO
  9     IRQ9 SPU
  10    IRQ10 Controller - Lightpen Interrupt. Also shared by PIO and DTL cards.
  11-15 Not used (always zero)
  16-31 Garbage

#### Interrupt Request / Execution
The interrupt request bits in I\_STAT are edge-triggered, ie. the get set ONLY
if the corresponding interrupt source changes from "false to true".<br/>
If one or more interrupts are requested and enabled, ie. if "(I\_STAT AND
I\_MASK)=nonzero", then cop0r13.bit10 gets set, and when cop0r12.bit10 and
cop0r12.bit0 are set, too, then the interrupt gets executed.<br/>

#### Interrupt Acknowledge
To acknowledge an interrupt, write a "0" to the corresponding bit in I\_STAT.
Most interrupts (except IRQ0,4,5,6) must be additionally acknowledged at the
I/O port that has caused them (eg. JOY\_CTRL.bit4).<br/>
Observe that the I\_STAT bits are edge-triggered (they get set only on
High-to-Low, or False-to-True edges). The correct acknowledge order is:<br/>
```
  First, acknowledge I_STAT                (eg. I_STAT.bit7=0)
  Then, acknowledge corresponding I/O port (eg. JOY_CTRL.bit4=1)
```
When doing it vice-versa, the hardware may miss further IRQs (eg. when first
setting JOY\_CTRL.4=1, then a new IRQ may occur in JOY\_STAT.4 within a single
clock cycle, thereafter, setting I\_STAT.7=0 would successfully reset I\_STAT.7,
but, since JOY\_STAT.4 is already set, there'll be no further edge, so I\_STAT.7
won't be ever set in future).<br/>

#### COP0 Interrupt Handling
Relevant COP0 registers are cop0r13 (CAUSE, reason flags), and cop0r12 (SR,
control flags), and cop0r14 (EPC, return address), and, cop0cmd=10h (aka RFE
opcode) is used to prepare the return from interrupts. For more info, see<br/>
[COP0 - Exception Handling](cpuspecifications.md#cop0-exception-handling)<br/>

#### PSX specific COP0 Notes
COP0 has six hardware interrupt bits, of which, the PSX uses only cop0r13.bit10
(the other ones, cop0r13.bit11-15 are always zero). cop0r13.bit10 is NOT a
latch, ie. it gets automatically cleared as soon as "(I\_STAT AND I\_MASK)=zero",
so there's no need to do an acknowledge at the cop0 side. COP0 additionally has
two software interrupt bits, cop0r13.bit8-9, which do exist in the PSX, too,
these bits are read/write-able latches which can be set/cleared manually to
request/acknowledge exceptions by software.<br/>

#### PS2 IOP interrupts
The PS2's IOP has the same interrupt controller as the PS1 but with more
channels. For more details, see:<br/>

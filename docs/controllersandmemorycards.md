##   Controller and Memory Card Overview
Controllers and memory cards connect to the console using a serial protocol and
are accessed through SIO0 registers:<br/>
[Serial Interfaces (SIO)](serialinterfacessio.md)<br/>
The protocol used is similar to standard SPI, with no start/stop bytes and no
parity (even though SIO0 has support for it). Unlike typical SPI, only one byte
is transferred at a time and a separate wire (/ACK) is used by the device to
signal the PS1 that it is ready to exchange the next byte. For more details see:<br/>
[Controller and Memory Card Signals](controllersandmemorycards.md#controller-and-memory-card-signals)<br/>

#### Device addressing
Each controller port and its respective memory card slot are wired in parallel,
and the /CSn signals select both the controller and the memory card when
asserted. This selection is narrowed down through a simple addressing scheme,
where the first byte sent by the console after asserting /CSn is the address of
the device that shall reply. All devices must keep the DAT line idle before
receiving this byte. Once the address is sent, the device that was addressed
shall pull /ACK low to signal its presence and start exchanging bytes.<br/>
The following addresses are known to be used:<br/>

| Device                               | Address |
| :----------------------------------- | ------: |
| Standard controller                  |   `01h` |
| Yaroze Access Card                   |   `21h` |
| PS2 multitap (incompatible with PS1) |   `21h` |
| PS2 DVD remote receiver              |   `61h` |
| Memory card                          |   `81h` |

#### DSR (/ACK) Controller and Memory Card - Byte Received Interrupt
Gets set after receiving a data byte - that only if an /ACK has been received
from the peripheral (ie. there will be no IRQ if the peripheral fails to send
an /ACK, or if there's no peripheral connected at all).<br/>
```
  Actually, DSR means "more-data-request",
  accordingly, it does NOT get triggered after receiving the LAST byte.
```
I\_STAT.7 is edge triggered (that means it can be acknowledge before or after
acknowledging SIO0\_STAT.9). However, SIO0\_STAT.9 is NOT edge triggered (that
means it CANNOT be acknowledged while the external /IRQ input is still low; ie.
one must first wait until SIO0\_STAT.7=0, and then set SIO0\_CTRL.4=1) (this is
apparently a hardware glitch; note: the LOW duration is circa 100 clock
cycles).<br/>

#### /IRQ10 (/IRQ) Controller - Lightpen Interrupt
Pin 8 on Controller Port. Routed directly to the Interrupt Controller (at
1F80107xh). There are no status/enable bits in the SIO0\_registers (at
1F80104xh).<br/>

#### Plugging and Unplugging Cautions
During plugging and unplugging, the Serial Data line may be dragged LOW for a
moment; this may also affect other connected devices because the same Data line
is shared for all controllers and memory cards (for example, connecting a
joypad in slot 1 may corrupt memory card accesses in slot 2).<br/>
Moreover, the Sony Mouse does power-up with /ACK=LOW, and stays stuck in that
state until it is accessed at least once (by at least sending one 01h byte to
its controller port); this will also affect other devices (as a workaround one
should always access BOTH controller ports; even if a game uses only one
controller, and, code that waits for /ACK=HIGH should use timeouts).<br/>

#### Emulation Note
After sending a byte, the Kernel waits 100 cycles or so, and does THEN
acknowledge any old IRQ7, and does then wait for the new IRQ7. Due to that
bizarre coding, emulators can't trigger IRQ7 immediately within 0 cycles after
sending the byte.<br/>

#### BIOS Functions
Controllers can be probably accessed via InitPad and StartPad functions,<br/>
[BIOS Joypad Functions](kernelbios.md#bios-joypad-functions)<br/>
Memory cards can be accessed by the filesystem (with device names "bu00:"
(slot1) and "bu10:" (slot2) or so). Before using that device names, it seems to
be required to call InitCard, StartCard, and \_bu\_init (?).<br/>

#### Synchronous I/O
The data is transferred in units of bytes, via separate input and output lines.
So, when sending byte, the hardware does simultaneously receive a response
byte.<br/>
One exception is the address byte (which selects either the controller,
or the memory card) until that byte has been sent, neither the controller nor
memory card are selected (and so the first "response" byte should be ignored;
probably containing more or less stable high-z levels).<br/>
The other exception is, when you have send all command bytes, and still want to
receive further data, then you'll need to send dummy command bytes (should be
usually 00h) to receive the response bytes.<br/>

Notes:

- All bytes are sent LSB first.
- The standard baud rate used by the kernel is ~250 kHz. Some controllers and
  memory cards may work with faster rates, but others will not.
- The clock polarity is high-when-idle (sometimes referred to as CPOL=1). Each
  bit is output on a falling clock edge and sampled by the other end on the
  rising clock edge that follows it (CPHA=1).
- The device has to pull /ACK low for at least 2 µs to request the host to
  transfer another byte. Once the last byte of the packet is transferred, the
  device shall no longer pulse /ACK.
- The kernel's controller driver will time out if /ACK is not pulled low by the
  device within 100 µs from the last SCK pulse. It will also ignore /ACK pulses
  sent within the first 2-3 µs (100 cycles) of the last SCK pulse.
- Devices should not respond immediately when /CS is asserted, but should wait
  for the address byte to be sent and only send an /ACK pulse back and start
  replying with data if the address matches.

##   Controller and Memory Card Multitap Adaptor
#### SCPH-1070 (Multitap)
The Multitap is an external adaptor that allows to connect 4 controllers, and 4
memory cards to one controller port. When using two adaptors (one on each
slot), up to 8 controllers and 8 memory cards can be used.<br/>

#### Multitap Controller Access
Normally joypad reading is done by sending this bytes to the pad:<br/>
```
  01 42 00 00 ..   ;normal read
```
And with the multitap, there are even two different ways how to access extra
pads:<br/>
```
  01 42 01 00 ..   ;method 1: receive special ID and data from ALL four pads
  0n 42 00 00 ..   ;method 2: receive data from pad number "n" (1..4)
```
The first method seems to be the more commonly used one (and its special ID is
also good for detecting the multitap); see below for details.<br/>
The second method works more like "normal" reads, among other it's allowing to
transfer more than 4 halfwords per slot (unknown if any existing games are
using that feature).<br/>
The IRQ10 signal (for Konami Lightguns) is simply wired to all four slots via
small resistors (without special logic for activating/deactivating the IRQ on
certain slots).<br/>

#### Multitap Controller Access, Method 1 Details
Below LONG response is activated by sending "01h" as third command byte;
observe that sending that byte does NOT affect the current response. Instead,
it does request that the NEXT command shall return special data, as so:<br/>
```
  Halfword 0      --> Controller ID for MultiTap (5A80h=Multitap)
  Halfword 1..4   --> Player A (Controller ID, Buttons, Analog Inputs, if any)
  Halfword 5..8   --> Player B (Controller ID, Buttons, Analog Inputs, if any)
  Halfword 9..12  --> Player C (Controller ID, Buttons, Analog Inputs, if any)
  Halfword 13..16 --> Player D (Controller ID, Buttons, Analog Inputs, if any)
```
With this method, the Multitap is always sending 4 halfwords per slot (padded
with FFFFh values for devices like Digital Joypads and Mice; which do use less
than 4 halfwords); for empty slots it's padding all 4 halfwords with FFFFh.<br/>
Sending the request is possible ONLY if there is a controller in Slot A (if
controller Slot A is empty then the Slot A access aborts after the FIRST byte,
and it's thus impossible to send the request in the THIRD byte).<br/>
Sending the request works on access to Slot A, trying to send another request
during the LONG response is glitchy (for whatever strange reason); one must
thus REPEATEDLY do TWO accesses: one dummy Slot A access (with the request),
followed by the long Slot A+B+C+D access.<br/>
```
  Previous access had REQ=0 and returned Slot A data ---> returns Slot A data
  Previous access had REQ=0 and returned Slot A-D data -> returns Slot A data
  Previous access had REQ=1 and returned Slot A data ---> returns Slot A-D data
  Previous access had REQ=1 and returned Slot A-D data -> returns garbage
  Previous access had REQ=1 and returned garbage -------> returns Slot A-D data
```
In practice:<br/>
Toggling REQ on/off after each command: Returns responses toggling between
normal Slot A data and long Slot A+B+C+D data.<br/>
Sending REQ=1 in ALL commands: Returns responses toggling between Garbage and
long Slot A+B+C+D data.<br/>
Both of the above is working (one needs only the Slot A+B+C+D part, and it
doesn't matter if the other part is Slot A, or Garbage; as long as the software
is able/aware of ignoring the Garbage). Garbage response means that the
multitap returns ONLY four bytes, like so: Hiz,80h,5Ah,LSB (ie. the leading
HighZ byte, the 5A80h Multitap ID, and the LSB of the Slot A controller ID),
and aborts transfer after that four bytes.<br/>

#### Multitap Memory Card Access
Normally memory card access is done by sending this bytes to the card:<br/>
```
  80 xx .. ..      ;normal access
```
And with the multitap, memory cards can be accessed as so:<br/>
```
  8n xx .. ..      ;access memory card in slot "n" (1..4)
```
That's the way how its done in Silent Hill. Although for the best of confusion,
it doesn't actually work in that game (probably the developer has just linked
in the multitap library, without actually supporting the multitap at higher
program levels).<br/>

#### Multitap Games
```
  Bomberman / Bomberman Party Edition (requires Multitap on Port 2 instead of 1)
  Bomberman World
  Breakout: Off the Wall Fun
  Circuit Breakers
  Crash Team Racing
  FIFA series soccer games
  Frogger
  Gauntlet: Dark Legacy
  Hot Shots Golf 2 & 3
  Jigsaw Island: Japan Graffiti / Jigsaw Madness (requires Multitap on Port 2 instead of 1)
  NBA Live (any year) (up to 8 players with two multitaps)
  Need For Speed 3
  Need For Speed 5
  Poy Poy (4 players hitting each other with rocks and trees)
  Running Wild
  S.C.A.R.S. (requires Multitap on Port 2 instead of 1)
  Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling: Ouja no Tamashii (requires Multitap on Port 2 instead of 1)
```
Most Multitap games supporting up to 4 or 5 controllers require the device to be plugged into Port 1, but a small number of games strangely require the device to be plugged into Port 2 instead.<br/>

#### Multitap Versions

  |    A        B        /
  '---------------------'
```
The cable connects to one of the PSX controller ports (which also carries the
memory card signals). The PSX memory card port is left unused (and is blocked
by a small edge on the Multitap's plug).<br/>

#### MultiTap Parsed Controller IDs
Halfword 0 is parsed (by the BIOS) as usually, ie. the LSB is moved to MSB, and
LSB is replaced by status byte (so ID 5A80h becomes 8000h=Multitap/okay, or
xxFFh=bad). Halfwords 1,5,9,13 are NOT parsed (neither by the BIOS nor by the
Multitap hardware), however, some info in the internet is hinting that Sony's
libraries might be parsing these IDs too (so for example 5A41h would become
4100h=DigitalPad/okay, or xxFFh=bad).<br/>

#### Power Supply
The Multitap is powered by the PSX controller port. Unknown if there are any
power supply restrictions (up to eight controllers and eight cards may scratch
some limits, especially when doing things like activating rumble on all
joypads). However, the Multitap hardware itself doesn't do much on supply
restrictions (+3.5V is passed through something; maybe some fuse, loop, or 1
ohm resistor or so) (and +7.5V is passed without any restrictions).<br/>

#### PS2 multitap
Sony made a multitap adapter for the PS2, however it is not compatible with the
PS1 as it plugs into both the controller and memory card ports (which are not
wired in parallel on the PS2). The protocol is also different: rather than
modifying packets it seems to act as a mostly-passive port multiplexer,
accepting switching commands with address 61h. Unknown if the PS2 multitap is
backwards compatible with the SCPH-1070 protocol.<br/>

The TAP byte should be usually zero, unless one wants to activate Multitap
(multi-player mode), for details, see<br/>
[Controller and Memory Card Multitap Adaptor](controllersandmemorycards.md#controller-and-memory-card-multitap-adaptor)<br/>
The two MOT bytes are meant to control the rumble motors (for normal non-rumble
controllers, that bytes should be 00h), however, the MOT bytes have no effect
unless rumble is enabled via config commands, for details, see<br/>
[Controllers - Configuration Commands](controllersandmemorycards.md#controllers-configuration-commands)<br/>

```
Known 16bit ID values are:<br/>
```
  xx00h=N/A                 (initial buffer value from InitPad BIOS function)

  5A7xh=Dualshock2          (with variable number of inputs enabled)
  5A79h=Dualshock2          (with all analog/digital inputs enabled)
  5A80h=Multitap            (multiplayer adaptor) (when activated)
  5A96h=Keyboard            (rare lightspan keyboard)
  5AE3h=Jogcon              (steering dial)
  5AE8h=Keyboard/Sticks     (rare homebrew keyboard/segasticks adaptor)
  5AF3h=Config Mode         (when in config mode; see rumble command 43h)
  FFFFh=High-Z              (no controller connected, pins floating High-Z)
```
The PS2 DVD remote receiver identifies as either 5A41h (i.e. a digital
controller) when polled using standard controller commands, or 5A12h when using
address 61h to access the IR functionality.<br/>

#### Analog Mode Note
On power-up, the controllers are in digital mode (with analog inputs disabled).
Analog mode can be (de-)activated manually by pushing the Analog button.
Alternately, analog mode can be (de-)activated by software via rumble
configuration commands (though that's supported only on newer pads; those with
two rumble motors). It is essential that emulators and any third-party hardware have a way of manually toggling analog mode, similar to original analog controllers, as certain games like Gran Turismo 1 will not attempt to enter analog mode on their own, even if they support analog controls and detect an analog controller.<br/>
Since analog pads boot in digital mode and will return the same ID byte as digital controllers, the most common way of distinguishing between the 2 is to send a Dualshock-only command (Typically command 43h - enter/exit config mode) and seeing how the controller responds to it.<br/>
The analog sticks are mechanically restricted to a "circular field of motion"
(most joypads can reach "min/max" values only in "straight" horizontal or
vertical directions, but not in "diagonal" directions).<br/>

  SCPH-110           Min=(11,11), Mid: (8A..9F,70..96), Max=(FD,FD) at 16'C
```
Values may vary for other pads and/or different temperatures.<br/>

#### Dual Analog Pad in LED=Green Mode
Basically same as normal analog LED=Red mode, with following differences:<br/>
```
  ID is 5A53h (identifying itself as analog stick) (rather than analog pad)
  Left/right joy-buttons disabled (as for real analog stick, bits are always 1)
  Some buttons are re-arranged: bit9=L1 bit10=[] bit11=/\ bit12=R1 bit15=R2
```
Concerning the button names, the real analog-stick does NOT have re-arranged
buttons (eg. it's L1 button is in bit10), however, concerning the button
locations, the analog stick's buttons are arranged completely differently as on
analog pads (so it might be rather uncomfortable to play analog stick games on
analog pads in LED=Red mode; the LED=Green mode is intended to solve that
problem).<br/>
Might be useful for a few analog-stick games like MechWarrior 2, Ace Combat 2,
Descent Maximum, and Colony Wars. In most other cases the feature is rather
confusing (that's probably why the LED=Green mode wasn't implemented on the
Dual Shock).<br/>

#### Sony Mouse Hardware Bug on Power-On
On Power-on (or when newly connecting it), the Sony mouse does draw /ACK to LOW
on power-on, and does then hold /ACK stuck in the LOW position.<br/>
For reference: Normal controllers and memory cards set /ACK=LOW only for around
100 clk cycles, and only after having received a byte from the console.<br/>
The /ACK pin is shared for both controllers and both memory cards, so the stuck
/ACK is also "blocking" all other connected controllers/cards. To release the
stuck /ACK signal: Send a command (at least one 01h byte) to both controller
slots.<br/>

Note: There are probably many more mouse compatible games.<br/>
Certain games, mostly FPS games such as Quake II and Doom, have players plug a standard digital/analog pad in port 1
and a mouse in port 2. This way, players can use the mouse for aiming and shooting, while the pad can be used for moving, reloading, and so on.<br/>

#### PS/2 and USB Mouse Adaptors
Some keyboard adaptors are also including a mouse adaptor feature (either by
simulating normal Sony Mouse controller data, or via more uncommon ways like
using the PSX expansion port).<br/>
[Controllers - Keyboards](controllersandmemorycards.md#controllers-keyboards)<br/>

#### RS232 Mice
Below is some info on RS232 serial mice. That info isn't directly PSX related
as the PSX normally doesn't support those mice.<br/>
With some efforts, one can upgrade the PSX SIO port to support RS232 voltages,
and with such a modded console one could use RS232 mice (in case one wants to
do that).<br/>
The nocash PSX bios can map a RS232 mouse to a spare controller slot (thereby
simulating a Sony mouse), that trick may work with various PSX games.<br/>

#### Standard Serial Mouse
A serial mouse should be read at 1200 bauds, 7 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
(7N1) with DTR and RTS on. For best compatibility, the mouse should output 2
stop bits (so it could be alternately also read as 7N2 or 8N1). When the mouse
gets moved, or when a button gets pressed/released, the mouse sends 3 or 4
characters:<br/>
```
  __First Character____________________
  6    First Character Flag (1)
  5    Left Button  (1=Pressed)
  4    Right Button (1=Pressed)
  2-3  Upper 2bit of Vertical Motion
  0-1  Upper 2bit of Horizontal Motion
  __Second Character___________________
  6    Non-first Character Flag (0)
  5-0  Lower 6bit of Horizontal Motion
  __Third Character____________________
  6    Non-first Character Flag (0)
  5-0  Lower 6bit of Vertical Motion
  __Fourth Character (if any)__________
  6    Non-first Character Flag (0)
  5    Middle Button (1=Pressed)
  4    Unused ???
  3-0  Wheel  ???
```
Additionally, the mouse outputs a detection character (when switching RTS (or
DTR?) off and on:<br/>
```
  "M" = Two-Button Mouse (aka "Microsoft" mouse)
  "3" = Three-Button Mouse (aka "Logitech" mouse)
  "Z" = Mouse-Wheel
```
Normally, the detection response consist of a single character (usually "M"),
though some mice have the "M" followed by 11 additional characters of garbage
or version information (these extra characters have bit6=0, so after detection,
one should ignore all characters until receiving the first data character with
bit6=1).<br/>

#### Mouse Systems Serial Mouse (rarely used)
Accessed at 1200 bauds, just like standard serial mouse, but with 8N1 instead
7N1, and with different data bytes.<br/>
```
  __First Byte_________________________
  7-3  First Byte Code (10000b)
  2    Left? Button   (0=Pressed)
  1    Middle? Button (0=Pressed)
  0    Right? Button  (0=Pressed)
  __Second Byte________________________
  7-0  Horizontal Motion (X1)
  __Third Byte_________________________
  7-0  Vertical Motion   (Y1)
  __Fourth Byte________________________
  7-0  Horizontal Motion (X2)
  __Fifth Byte_________________________
  7-0  Vertical Motion   (Y2)
```
The strange duplicated 8bit motion values are usually simply added together,
ie. X=X1+X2 and Y=Y1+Y2, producing 9bit motion values.<br/>

#### Notes
The Sony Mouse connects directly to the PSX controller port. Alternately serial
RS232 mice can be connected to the SIO port (with voltage conversion adaptor)
(most or all commercial games don't support SIO mice, nor does the original
BIOS do so, however, the nocash BIOS maps SIO mice to unused controller slots,
so they can be used even with commercial games; if the game uses BIOS functions
to read controller data).<br/>
Serial Mice (and maybe also the Sony mouse) do return raw mickeys, so effects
like double speed threshold must (should) be implemented by software. Mice are
rather rarely used by PSX games. The game "Perfect Assassin" includes
ultra-crude mouse support, apparently without threshold, and without properly
matching the cursor range to the screen resolution.<br/>

```
The Twist controller works like a paddle or steering wheel, but doesn't have a
wheel or knob, instead, it can be twisted: To move into one direction (=maybe
right?), turn its right end away from you (or its left end towards you). For
the opposite direction (=maybe left?), do it vice-versa.<br/>

#### Namco Volume Controller (a paddle with two buttons) (SLPH-00015)
This is a cut-down variant of the neGcon, just a featureless small box. It does
have the same ID value as neGcon (ID=5A23h), but, it excludes most digital, and
all analog buttons.<br/>
```

#### SANKYO N.ASUKA aka Nasca Pachinco Handle (SLPH-00007)
Another cut-down variant of the neGcon (with ID=5A23h, too). But, this one
seems to have only one button. Unlike Namco's volume controller it doesn't look
featureless. It looks pretty much as shown in the ascii-arts image below. Seems
to be supported by several irem titles. No idea what exactly it is used for,
it's probably not a sewing machine controller, nor an electronic amboss.<br/>

#### Mad Catz Steering Wheel (SLEH-0006)
A neGcon compatible controller. The Twist-feature has been replaced by a
steering wheel (can be turned by 270 degrees), and the analog I and II buttons
by foot pedals. The analog L button has been replaced by a digital button (ie.
in neGcon mode, the last byte of the controller data can be only either 00h or
FFh). When not using the pedals, the I/II buttons on the wheel can be used
(like L button, they aren't analog though).<br/>

```

Unlike the neGon, the controller has Select, \>\< and [] buttons, and a
second set of L/R buttons (at the rear-side of the wheel) (no idea if L1/R1 or
L2/R2 are at front?). Aside from the neGcon mode, the controller can be also
switched to Digital mode (see below for button chart).<br/>

#### MadCatz Dual Force Racing Wheel
Same as above, but with a new Analog mode (additionally to Digital and neGcon
modes). The new mode is for racing games that support only Analog Joypads
(instead of neGcon). Additionally it supports vibration feedback.<br/>

#### MadCatz MC2 Vibration compatible Racing Wheel and Pedals
Same as above, but with a redesigned wheel with rearranged buttons, the digital
pad moved to the center of the wheel, the L/R buttons at the rear-side of the
wheel have been replaced by 2-way butterfly buttons ("pull towards user" acts
as normal, the new "push away from user" function acts as L3/R3).<br/>

   1-15 dial rotation (signed offset since last read?) (or absolute position?)
 halfword3:
   0    flag: dial was turned left  (0=no, 1=yes)
   1    flag: dial was turned right (0=no, 1=yes)
   2-15 unknown
```
Rotations of the dial are recognized by an optical sensor (so, unlike
potentiometers, the dial can be freely rotated; by more than 360 degrees). The
dial is also connected to a small motor, giving it a real force-feedback effect
(unlike all other PSX controllers which merely have vibration feedback).
Although that's great, the mechanics are reportedly rather cheap and using the
controller doesn't feel too comfortable. The Jogcon is used only by Ridge Racer
4 for PS1 (and Ridge Racer 5 for PS2), and Breakout - Off the Wall Fun.<br/>
The Mode button probably allows to switch between Jogcon mode and Digital Pad
mode (similar to the Analog button on other pads), not sure if the mode can be
also changed by software via configuration commands...? Unknown how the motor
is controlled; probably somewhat similar to vibration motors, ie. by the M1
and/or M2 bytes, but there must be also a way to select clockwise and
anticlockwise direction)...? The controller does reportedly support config
command 4Dh (same as analog rumble).<br/>

##   Controllers - Lightguns
There are two different types of PSX lightguns (which are incompatible with
each other).<br/>

#### Namco Lightgun (GunCon)
Namco's Cinch-based lightguns are extracting Vsync/Hsync timings from the video
signal (via a cinch adaptor) (so they are working completely independed of
software timings).<br/>
[Controllers - Lightguns - Namco (GunCon)](controllersandmemorycards.md#controllers-lightguns-namco-guncon)<br/>

#### Konami Lightgun (IRQ10)
Konami's IRQ10-based lightguns are using the lightgun input on the controller
slot (which requires IRQ10/timings being properly handled at software side).<br/>
[Controllers - Lightguns - Konami Justifier/Hyperblaster (IRQ10)](controllersandmemorycards.md#controllers-lightguns-konami-justifierhyperblaster-irq10)<br/>
The IRQ10-method is reportedly less accurate (although that may be just due to
bugs at software side).<br/>

#### Third-Party Lightguns
There are also a lot of unlicensed lightguns which are either IRQ10-based, or
Cinch-based, or do support both.<br/>
For example, the Blaze Scorpion supports both IRQ10 and Cinch, and it does
additionally have a rumble/vibration function; though unknown how that rumble
feature is accessed, and which games are supporting it).<br/>

#### Lightgun Games
[Controllers - Lightguns - PSX Lightgun Games](controllersandmemorycards.md#controllers-lightguns-psx-lightgun-games)<br/>

#### Compatibilty Notes (IRQ10 vs Cinch, PAL vs NTSC, Calibration)
Some lightguns are reportedly working only with PAL or only with NTSC games
(unknown which guns, and unknown what is causing problems; the IRQ10 method
should be quite hardware independed, the GunCon variant, too, although
theoretically, some GunCon guns might have problems to extract Vsync/Hsync from
either PAL or NTSC composite signals).<br/>
Lightguns from different manufacturers are reportedly returning slightly
different values, so it would be recommended to include a calibration function
in the game, using at least one calibration point (that would also resolve
different X/Y offsets caused by modifying GP1 display control registers).<br/>
Lightguns are needing to sense light from the cathode ray beam; as such they
won't work on regions of the screen that contain too dark/black graphics.<br/>



##   Controllers - Lightguns - Namco (GunCon)
#### GunCon Cinch-based Lightguns (Namco)
```
  __Halfword 0 (Controller Info)___________________
  0-15  Controller Info  (5A63h=Namco Lightgun; GunCon/Cinch Type)
  __Halfword 1 (Buttons)___________________________

  __Halfword 3 (Y)_________________________________
  0-15  Scanlines since VSYNC (05h/0Ah=Error, PAL=20h..127h, NTSC=19h..F8h)
```
Caution: The gun should be read only shortly after begin of VBLANK.<br/>

#### Error/Busy Codes
Coordinates X=0001h, Y=0005h indicates "unexpected light":<br/>
```
  ERROR: Sensed light during VSYNC (eg. from a Bulb or Sunlight).
```
Coordinates X=0001h, Y=000Ah indicates "no light", this can mean either:<br/>
```
  ERROR: no light sensed at all (not aimed at screen, or screen too dark).
  BUSY: no light sensed yet (when trying to read gun during rendering).
```
To avoid the BUSY error, one should read the gun shortly after begin of VBLANK
(ie. AFTER rendering, but still BEFORE vsync). Doing that isn't as simple as
one might think:<br/>
On a NTSC console, time between VBLANK and VSYNC is around 30000 cpu clks,
reading the lightgun (or analog joypads) takes around 15000 cpu clks. So,
reading two controllers within that timeframe may be problematic (and reading
up to eight controllers via multitaps would be absolutely impossible). As a
workaround, one may arrange the read-order to read lightguns at VBLANK (and
joypads at later time). If more than one lightgun is connected, then one may
need to restrict reading to only one (or maybe: max two) guns per frame.<br/>

#### Minimum Brightness
Below are some average minimum brightness values, the gun may be unable to
return position data near/below that limits (especially coordinates close to
left screen border are most fragile). The exact limits may vary from gun to
gun, and will also depend on the TV Set's brightness setting.<br/>
```
  666666h Minimum Gray
  770000h Minimum Blue
  007700h Minimum Green
  000099h Minimum Red
```
The gun does also work with mixed colors (eg. white bold text on black
background works without errors, but the returned coordinates are a bit "jumpy"
in that case; returning the position of the closest white pixels).<br/>
BUG: On a plain RED screen, aiming at Y\>=00F0h, the gun is randomly
returning either Y, or Y-80h (that error occurs in about every 2nd frame, ie.
at 50% chance). It's strange... no idea what is causing that effect.<br/>

#### Coordinates
The coordinates are updated in all frames (as opposed to some lightguns which
do update them only when pulling the trigger).<br/>
The absolute min/max coordinates may vary from TV set to TV set (some may show
a few more pixels than others). The relation of the gun's Screen Coodinates to
VRAM Coordinates does (obviously) depend on where the VRAM is located on the
screen; ie. on the game's GP1(06h) and GP1(07h) settings.<br/>
Vertical coordinates are counted in scanlines (ie. equal to pixels). Horizontal
coordinates are counted in 8MHz units (which would equal a resolution of 385
pixels; which can be, for example, converted to 320 pixel resolution as
X=X\*320/385).<br/>

##   Controllers - Lightguns - Konami Justifier/Hyperblaster (IRQ10)
#### Overall IRQ10-Based Lightgun Access
```
  Send  01h 42h 00h x0h 00h
  Reply HiZ 31h 5Ah buttons
```
The purpose of the "x0h" byte is probably to enable IRQ10 (00h=off, 10h=on),
this would allow to access more than one lightgun (with only one per frame
having the IRQ enabled).<br/>

#### Standard IRQ10-based Lightguns (Konami)
The Controller Data simply consists of the ID and buttons states:<br/>
```
  __Halfword 0 (Controller Info)___________________

The coordinates aren't part of the controller data, instead they must be read
from Timer 0 and 1 upon receiving IRQ10 (see IRQ10 Notes below).<br/>

#### Konami IRQ10 Notes
The PSX does have a lightgun input (Pin 8 of the controller), but, Sony did
apparently "forget" to latch the current cathode ray beam coordinates by
hardware when sensing the lightgun signal (quite strange, since that'd be a
simple, inexpensive, and very obvious feature for a gaming console).<br/>
Instead, the lightgun signal triggers IRQ10, and the interrupt handler is
intended to "latch" the coordinates by software (by reading Timer 0 and 1
values, which must configured to be synchronized with the GPU).<br/>
That method requires IRQ handling to be properly implemented in software
(basically, IRQs should not be disabled for longer periods, and DMA transfers
should not block the bus for longer periods). In practice, most programmers
probably don't realize how to do that, to the worst, Sony seems to have
delivered a slightly bugged library (libgun) to developers.<br/>
For details on Timers, see:<br/>
[Timers](timers.md)<br/>
In some consoles, IRQ10 seems to be routed through a Secondary IRQ Controller,
see:<br/>
[EXP2 DTL-H2000 I/O Ports](expansionportpio.md#exp2-dtl-h2000-io-ports)<br/>

#### IRQ10 Priority
For processing IRQ10 as soon as possible, it should be assigned higher priority
than all other IRQs (ie. when using the SysEnqIntRP BIOS function, it should be
the first/newest element in priority chain 0). The libgun stuff assigns an even
higher priority by patching the BIOS exception handler, causing IRQ10 to be
processed shortly before processing the priority chains (the resulting IRQ
priority isn't actually higher as when using 1st element of chain 0; the main
difference is that it skips some time consuming code which pushes registers
R4..R30). For details on that patch, see:<br/>
[BIOS Patches](kernelbios.md#bios-patches)<br/>
Even if IRQ10 has highest priority, execution of (older) other IRQs may cause a
new IRQ10 to be executed delayed (because IRQs are disabled during IRQ
handling), to avoid that problem: Best don't enable any other IRQs except IRQ0
and IRQ10, or, if you need other IRQs, best have them enabled only during
Vblank (there are no scanlines drawn during vblank, so IRQ10 should never
trigger during that period). DMAs might also slow down IRQ execution, so best
use them only during Vblank, too.<br/>

#### IRQ10 Timer Reading
To read the current timer values the IRQ10 handler would be required to be
called \<immediately\> after receiving the IRQ10 signal, which is more or
less impossible; if the main program is trying to read a mul/div/gte result
while the mul/div/gte operation is still busy may stop the CPU for some dozens
of clock cycles, and active DMA transfers or cache hits and misses in the IRQ
handler may cause different timings, moreover, timings may become completely
different if IRQs are disabled (eg. while another IRQ is processed).<br/>
However, IRQ10 does also get triggered in the next some scanlines, so the first
IRQ10 is used only as a notification that the CPU should watch out for further
IRQ10's. Ie. the IRQ10 handler should disable all DMAs, acknowledge IRQ10, and
then enter a waitloop that waits for the IRQ10 bit in I\_STAT to become set
again (or abort if a timeout occurs) and then read the timers, reportedly like
so:<br/>
```
  IF NTSC then X=(Timer0-140)*0.198166, Y=Timer1
  IF PAL  then X=(Timer0-140)*0.196358, Y=Timer1
```
No idea why PAL/NTSC should use different factors, that factors are looking
quite silly/bugged, theoretically, the pixel-to-clock ratio should be the
exactly same for PAL and NTSC...?<br/>
Mind that reading Timer values in Dotclock/Hblank mode is unstable, for Timer1
this can be fixed by the read-retry method, for Timer0 this could be done too,
but one would need to subtract the retry-time to get a correct coordinate;
alternately Timer0 can run at system clock (which doesn't require read-retry),
but it must be then converted to video clock (mul 11, div 7), and then from
video clock to dot clock (eg. div 8 for 320-pixel mode).<br/>
Above can be repeated for the next some scanlines (allowing to take the medium
values as result, and/or to eliminate faulty values which are much bigger or
smaller than the other values). Once when you have collected enough values,
disable IRQ10, so it won't trigger on further scanlines within the current
frame.<br/>

#### IRQ10 Bugs
BUG: The "libgun" library doesn't acknowledge the old IRQ10 \<immediately\>
before waiting for a new IRQ10, so the timer values after sensing the new IRQ10
are somewhat random (especially for the first processed scanline) (the library
allows to read further IRQ10's in further scanlines, which return more stable
results).<br/>
No idea how many times IRQ10 gets typically repeated? Sporting Clays allocates
a buffer for up to 20 scanlines (which would cause pretty much of a slowdown
since the CPU is just waiting during that period) (nethertheless, the game uses
only the first timer values, ie. the bugged libgun-random values).<br/>

Unknown if/how two-player games (with 2 lightguns) are working with the IRQ10
method... if IRQ10 is generated ONLY after pressing the trigger button, then it
may work, unless both players have Trigger pressed at the same time... and,
maybe one can enable/disable the lightguns by whatever commmand being sent to
the controller (presumably that "x0h" byte, see above), so that gun 1 generates
IRQ10 only in each second frame, and gun 2 only in each other frame...?<br/>

##   Controllers - Configuration Commands
Some controllers can be switched from Normal Mode to Config Mode. The Config
Mode was invented for activating the 2nd rumble motor in SCPH-1200 analog
joypads. Additionally, the Config commands can switch between analog/digital
inputs (without needing to manually press the Analog button), activate more
analog inputs (on Dualshock2), and read some type/status bytes.<br/>

#### Normal Mode
```
  42h "B" Read Buttons (and analog inputs when in analog mode)
  43h "C" Enter/Exit Configuration Mode (stay normal, or enter)
```
Transfer length in Normal Mode is 5 bytes (Digital mode), or 9 bytes (Analog
mode), or up to 21 bytes (Dualshock2).<br/>

#### Configuration Mode
```
  40h "@" Unused, or Dualshock2: Get/Set ButtonAttr?
  41h "A" Unused, or Dualshock2: Get Reply Capabilities
  42h "B" Read Buttons AND analog inputs (even when in digital mode)
  43h "C" Enter/Exit Configuration Mode (stay config, or exit)
  44h "D" Set LED State (analog mode on/off)
  45h "E" Get LED State (and Type/constants)
  46h "F" Get Variable Response A (depending on incoming bit)
  47h "G" Get whatever values (response HiZ F3h 5Ah 00h 00h 02h 00h 01h 00h)
  48h "H" Unknown (response HiZ F3h 5Ah 00h 00h 00h 00h 01h 00h)
  49h "I" Unused
  4Ah "J" Unused
  4Bh "K" Unused
  4Ch "L" Get Variable Response B (depending on incoming bit)
  4Dh "M" Get/Set RumbleProtocol
  4Eh "N" Unused
  4Fh "O" Unused, or Dualshock2: Set ReplyProtocol
```
Transfer length in Config Mode is always 9 bytes.<br/>

#### Normal Mode - Command 42h "B" - Read Buttons (and analog inputs when enabled)
```
  Send  01h 42h 00h xx  yy  (00h 00h 00h 00h) (...)
  Reply HiZ id  5Ah buttons ( analog-inputs ) (dualshock2 buttons...)
```
The normal read command, see Standard Controller chapter for details on buttons
and analog inputs. The xx/yy bytes have effect only if rumble is unlocked; use
Command 43h to enter config mode, and Command 4Dh to unlock rumble. Command 4Dh
has billions of combinations, among others allowing to unlock only one of the
two motors, and to exchange the xx/yy bytes, however, with the default values,
xx/yy are assigned like so:<br/>
```
  yy.bit0-7 ---> Left/Large Motor M1 (analog slow/fast) (00h=stop, FFh=fastest)
  xx.bit0   ---> Right/small Motor M2 (digital on/off)  (0=off, 1=on)
```
The Left/Large motor starts spinning at circa min=50h..60h, and, once when
started keeps spinning downto circa min=38h. The exact motor start boundary
depends on the current position of the weight (if it's at the "falling" side,
then gravity helps starting), and also depends on external movements (eg. it
helps if the user or the other rumble motor is shaking the controller), and may
also vary from controller to controller, and may also depend on the room
temperature, dirty or worn-out mechanics, etc.<br/>

#### Normal Mode - Command 43h "C" - Enter/Exit Configuration Mode
```
  Send  01h 43h 00h xx  00h (zero padded...)   (...)
  Reply HiZ id  5Ah buttons (analog inputs...) (dualshock2 buttons...)
```
When issuing command 43h from inside normal mode, the response is same as for
command 42h (button data) (and analog inputs when in analog mode) (but without
M1 and M2 parameters). While in config mode, the ID bytes are always "F3h 5Ah"
(instead of the normal analog/digital ID bytes).<br/>
```
  xx=00h Stay in Normal mode
  xx=01h Enter Configuration mode
```
Caution: Additionally to activating configuration commands, entering config
mode does also activate a Watchdog Timer which does reset the controller if
there's been no communication for about 1 second or so. The watchdog timer
remains active even when returning to normal mode via Exit Config command. The
reset does disable and lock rumble motors, and switches the controller to
Digital Mode (with LED=off, and analog inputs disabled). To prevent this, be
sure to keep issuing joypad reads even when not needing user input (eg. while
loading data from CDROM).<br/>
Caution 2: A similar reset occurs when the user pushes the Analog button; this
is causing rumble motors to be stopped and locked, and of course, the
analog/digital state gets changed.<br/>
Caution 3: If config commands were used, and the user does then push the analog
button, then the 5Ah-byte gets replaced by 00h (ie. responses change from "HiZ
id 5Ah ..." to "HiZ id 00h ...").<br/>

#### Config Mode - Command 42h "B" - Read Buttons AND analog inputs
```
  Send  01h 42h 00h M2  M1  00h 00h 00h 00h
  Reply HiZ F3h 5Ah buttons  analog-inputs
```
Same as command 42h in normal mode, but with forced analog response (ie. analog
inputs and L3/R3 buttons are returned even in Digital Mode with LED=Off).<br/>

#### Config Mode - Command 43h "C" - Enter/Exit Configuration Mode
```
  Send  01h 43h 00h xx  00h 00h 00h 00h 00h
  Reply HiZ F3h 5Ah 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h
```
Equivalent to command 43h in normal mode, but returning 00h bytes rather than
button data, can be used to return to normal mode.<br/>
```
  xx=00h Enter Normal mode (Exit Configuration mode)
  xx=01h Stay in Configuration mode
```
Back in normal mode, the rumble motors (if they were enabled) can be controlled
with normal command 42h.<br/>

#### Config Mode - Command 44h "D" - Set LED State (analog mode on/off)
```
  Send  01h 44h 00h Led Key 00h 00h 00h 00h
  Reply HiZ F3h 5Ah 00h 00h Err 00h 00h 00h
```
The Led byte can be:<br/>
```
  When Led=00h      --> Digital mode, with LED=Off
  When Led=01h      --> Analog mode, with LED=On/red
  When Led=02h..FFh --> Ignored (and, in case of dualshock2: set Err=FFh)
```
The Key byte can be:<br/>
```
  When Key=00h..02h --> Unlock (allow user to push Analog button)
  When Key=03h      --> Lock (stay in current mode, ignore Analog button)
  When Key=04h..FFh --> Acts same as (Key AND 03h)
```
The Err byte is usually 00h (except, Dualshock2 sets Err=FFh upon Led=02h..FFh;
older PSX/PSone controllers don't do that).<br/>

These commands do return a bunch of 00h bytes. These commands do not seem to be
used by any games (apart from the Dualshock2 commands being used by Dualshock2
games).<br/>

#### Note
Something called "Guitar Hero controller" does reportedly also support Config
commands. Unknown if that thing does have the same inputs & rumble motors
as normal analog PSX joypads, and if it does return special type values.<br/>



##   Controllers - Vibration/Rumble Control
Rumble (aka "Vibration Function") is basically controlled by two previously
unused bytes of the standard controller Read command.<br/>
There are two methods to control the rumble motors, the old method is very
simple (but supports only one motor), the new method envolves a bunch of new
configuration commands (and supports two motors).<br/>
```
  SCPH-1150  DualAnalog Pad with 1 motor                  ;-old rumble method
  SCPH-1200  DualAnalog Pad with 2 motors, PSX-design     ;\new rumble method
  SCPH-110   DualAnalog Pad with 2 motors, PSone-design   ;/
  SCPH-10010 DualAnalog Pad with 2 motors, PS2/Dualshock2 ;-plus analog buttons
  Blaze Scorpion Lightgun with rumble      ;\unknow how to control rumble
  Fishing controllers with rumble          ;/
  SCPH-1180 Analog Pad without rumble      ;\unknow if there're config commands
  SCPH-1110 Analog Stick without rumble    ;/for analog mode (probably not)
```

#### Old Method, one motor, no config commands (SCPH-1150, SCPH-1200, SCPH-110)
The SCPH-1150 doesn't support any special config commands, instead, rumble is
solely done via the normal joypad read command:<br/>
```
  Send  01h 42h 00h xx  yy  (00h 00h 00h 00h)
  Reply HiZ id  5Ah buttons ( analog-inputs )
```
The rumble motor is simply controlled by three bits in the xx/yy bytes:<br/>
```
  xx --> must be 40h..7Fh            (ie. bit7=0, bit6=1) ;\switches motor on
  yy --> must be 01h,03h,...,FDh,FFh (ie. bit0=1)         ;/
```
The motor control is digital on/off (no analog slow/fast), recommended values
would be yyxx=0140h=on, and yyxx=0000h=off.<br/>
LED state is don't care (rumble works with led OFF, RED, and GREEN). In absence
of config commands, the LED can be controlled only manually (via Analog
button), the current LED state is implied in the controller "id" byte.<br/>
For backwards compatibility, the above old method does also work on SCPH-1200
and SCPH-110 (for controlling the right/small motor), alternately those newer
pads can use the config commands (for gaining access to both motors).<br/>

#### New Method, two motors, with config commands (SCPH-1200, SCPH-110)
For using the new rumble method, one must unlock the new rumble mode, for that
purpose Sony has invented a "slightly" overcomplicated protocol with not less
than 16 new commands (the rumble relevant commands are 43h and 4Dh, also,
command 44h may be useful for activating analog inputs by software, and, once
when rumble is unlocked, command 42h is used to control the rumble motors).
Anyways, here's the full command set...<br/>
[Controllers - Configuration Commands](controllersandmemorycards.md#controllers-configuration-commands)<br/>
And, the rumble-specific config command is described below...<br/>

#### Config Mode - Command 4Dh "M" - Get/Set RumbleProtocol
```
  Send  01h 4Dh 00h aa  bb  cc  dd  ee  ff     ;<-- set NEW aa..ff values
  Reply Hiz F3h 5Ah aa  bb  cc  dd  ee  ff     ;<-- returns OLD aa..ff values
```
Bytes aa,bb,cc,dd,ee,ff control the meaning of the 4th,5th,6th,7th,8th,9th
command byte in the controller read command (Command 42h).<br/>
```
  00h      = Map Right/small Motor (Motor M2) to bit0 of this byte
  01h      = Map Left/Large Motor (Motor M1) to bit0-7 of this byte
  02h..FEh = Unknown (can be mapped, maybe for extra motors/outputs)
  FFh      = Map nothing to this byte
```
In practice, one would usually send either one of these command/values:<br/>
```
  Send  01h 4Dh 00h 00h 01h FFh FFh FFh FFh    ;enable new method (two motors)
  Send  01h 4Dh 00h FFh FFh FFh FFh FFh FFh    ;disable motor control
```
Alternately, one could swap the motors by swapping values in aa/bb. Or one
could map the motors anywhere to cc/dd/ee/ff (this will increase the command
length in digital mode, hence changing digital mode ID from 41h to 42h or 43h).
Or, one could map further rumble motors or other outputs to the six bytes (if
any such controller would exist).<br/>
In the initial state, aa..ff are all FFh, and the controller does then use the
old rumble control method (with only one motor). However, that old method gets
disabled once when having messed with config commands (unknown if/how one can
re-enable the old method by software).<br/>

#### Unknown Dualshock2 Vibration
Dualshock2 does reportedly have "two more levels of vibration", unknown what
that means and if it's used by any PSX or PS2 games... it might refer to the
small motor which usually has only 2 levels (on/off) and might have 4 levels
(fast/med/slow/off) on dualshock2... but, if so, it's unknown how to
control/unlock that feature.<br/>
Also, the PSone controller (SCPH-110) appear to have been released shortly
after Dualshock2, unknown if that means that it might have that feature, too.<br/>

#### Note
Rumble is a potentially annoying feature, so games that do support rumble
should also include an option to disable it.<br/>



##   Controllers - Analog Buttons (Dualshock2)
Dualshock2 has three new commands (40h,41h,4Fh) for configuring analog buttons.
Additionally, Command 45h does return a different type byte for Dualshock2.<br/>
Dualshock2 is a PS2 controller. However, it can be also used with PSX games
(either by connecting the controller to a PSX console, or by playing a PSX game
on a PS2 console).<br/>
The analog button feature is reportedly rarely used by PS2 games (and there
aren't any PSX games known to use it).<br/>

#### Config Mode - Command 40h "@" Dualshock2: Get/Set ButtonAttr?
```
  Send  01h 40h 00h Idx Val 00h 00h 00h 00h  ;<-- Set NEW Val, array[Idx]=Val
  Reply HiZ F3h 5Ah 00h 00h Val 00h 00h 00h  ;<-- Old Val (or FFh when Idx>0Bh)
```
Allows to change twelve 3bit values (with Idx=00h..0Bh, and Val=00h..03h).
Default is Val=02h. Purpose is unknown, the 12 values might be related to the
12 analog buttons, but there is no noticable difference between Val=0,1,2,3.
Maybe it does have some subtle effects on things like...<br/>
```
  Digital button sensitivity, or Analog button sensitivity, or
  Analog button bit-depth/conversion speed, or something else?
```

#### Config Mode - Command 41h "A" Dualshock2: Get Reply Capabilities
```
  Send  01h 41h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h
  Reply HiZ F3h 5Ah FFh FFh 03h 00h 00h 00h
```
This seems to return a constant bitmask indicating which reply bytes can be
enabled/disabled via Command 4Fh (ie. 3FFFFh = 18 bits).<br/>

#### Config Mode - Command 4Fh "O" Dualshock2: Set ReplyProtocol
```
  Send  01h 41h 00h aa  bb  cc  dd  ee  ff
  Reply HiZ F3h 5Ah 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h
```
This can output some 48bit value (bit0=aa.bit0, bit47=ff.bit7), used to
enable/disable Reply bytes in the controller read command (Command 42h).<br/>
```

  12     Button ><               (0=No, 1=Yes) button 06h  16th byte
  13     Button []               (0=No, 1=Yes) button 07h  17th byte

  17     Button R2               (0=No, 1=Yes) button 0Bh  21st byte
  18-39  Must be 0 (otherwise command is ignored)
  40-47  Unknown (no effect?)
```
Usually, one would use one of the following command/values:<br/>
```
  Send  01h 41h 00h 03h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h  Digital buttons
  Send  01h 41h 00h 3Fh 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h  Digital buttons + analog sticks
  Send  01h 41h 00h FFh FFh 03h 00h 00h 00h  Enable all 18 input bytes
```
The transfer order is 1st..21st byte as shown above (unless some bits are
cleared, eg. if bit0-5=0 and bit6=1 then DPAD Right would appear as 4th byte
instead of 10th byte). The command length increases/decreases depening on the
number of enabled bits. The transfer length is always 3+N\*2 bytes (including a
00h padding byte when the number of enabled bits is odd). The analog mode ID
byte changes depending on number of halfwords.<br/>
CAUTION: Sending Command 44h does RESET the Command 4Fh setting (either to
DigitalMode=000003h or AnalogMode=00003Fh; same happens when toggling mode via
Analog button).<br/>

Note: Some Dualshock2 Config Mode commands do occassionally send 00h, 5Ah, or
FFh as last (9th) reply byte (unknown if that is some error/status thing, or
garbage).<br/>

#### Analog Button Sensitivity
The pressure sensors are rather imprecise and results may vary on various
factors, including the pressure angle.<br/>
```
  00h       Button released
  01h..2Fh  Normal (soft) pressure
  30h..FEh  Medium pressure
  FFh       Hard pressure
```
Software can safely distinguish between soft and hard pressure.<br/>
Medium pressure is less predictably: The values do not increase linearily, it's
difficult to apply a specific amount of medium pressure (such like 80h..9Fh),
increasing pressure may sometimes jump from 24h to FFh, completely skipping the
medium range.<br/>
Relying on the medium range might work for accelleration buttons (where the
user could still adjust the pressure when the accelleration is too high or too
low); but it would be very bad practice to assign irreversible actions to
medium pressure (such like Soft=Load, Medium=Save, Hard=Quit).<br/>

#### Digital Button Sensitivity
Digital inputs are converting the analog inputs as so:<br/>
```
  Analog=00h      --> not pressed
  Analog=01h..FFh --> pressed (no matter if soft, medium, or hard pressure)
```
Digital inputs are working even when also having analog input enabled for the
same button.<br/>

##   Controllers - Dance Mats
PSX Dance Mats are essentially normal joypads with uncommonly arranged buttons,
the huge mats are meant to be put on the floor, so the user could step on them.<br/>

#### Dance Mat vs Joypad Compatibility
There are some differences to normal joypads: First of, the L1/L2/R1/R2
shoulder buttons are missing in most variants. And, the mats are allowing to
push Left+Right and Up+Down at once, combinations that aren't mechanically
possible on normal joypads (some dancing games do actually require those
combinations, whilst some joypad games may get confused on them).<br/>

#### Dance Mat Unknown Things
Unknown if the mat was sold in japan, and if so, with which SLPH/SCPH number.<br/>
Unknown if the mat's middle field is also having a button assigned.<br/>
Unknown if the mat is having a special controller ID, or if there are other
ways to detect mats (the mats are said to be compatible with skateboard games,
so the mats are probably identifying themselves as normal digital joypad;
assuming that those skateboard games haven't been specifically designed for
mats).<br/>

#### Dance Mat Games
```
  D.D.R. Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Remix
  (and maybe whatever further games)
```
The mats can be reportedly also used with whatever skateboard games.<br/>

#### Dance Mat Variants
There is the US version (DDR Dance Pad, SLUH-00071), and a slightly different
European version (Official Dance Mat, SLEH-00023: shiny latex style with
perverted colors, and Start/Select arranged differently). The japanese version
(RU017) resembles the US version, but without Triangle/Square symbols drawn in
lower left/right edges.<br/>
And there is a handheld version (with additional L1/L2/R2/R1 buttons; maybe
unlicensed; produced as MINI DDR, and also as Venom Mini Dance Pad).<br/>

#### Stay Cool?
Despite of the "Stay Cool!" slogan, the mat wasn't very cool - not at all! It
offered only two steps back-and-forth, and also allowed to do extremly uncool
side-steps. Not to mention that it would melt when dropping a burning cigarette
on it. Stay Away!<br/>



## Controllers - Pop'n Controllers
Controllers used for Konami's Pop'n Music series. At least a few different
versions of the controller (Pop'n Controller, Pop'n Controller 2, larger
arcade-size version, possibly others and in different color variations) have
been released for the PS1 and PS2. Unknown if the controllers released in the
PS2 era have any additional commands not present in the original Pop'n
Controller, but they are supposedly fully compatible with PS1 Pop'n Music games.

Pop'n Controllers report as digital controllers (ID byte 41h), but the left,
right, and down d-pad controls are not connected to any physical buttons and are
always reported as pressed (in the first transferred button byte, bits 5-7 are
always 0). Pop'n Music games check these bits to determine if a Pop'n Controller
is connected and will change the in-game controls accordingly if so.



## Controllers - Taiko Controllers (Tatacon)
Drum controllers made by Namco and used by the Taiko no Tatsujin series on the
PS2 (but compatible with the PS1, even though no PS1 Taiko game was ever made).
These controllers behave like standard digital pads (ID 41h) and contain four
hit sensors mapped to the following buttons:<br/>

| Sensor             | Button     | Bit |
| :----------------- | :--------- | --: |
| Left ka (rim)      | L1         |  10 |
| Right ka (rim)     | R1         |  11 |
| Left don (center)  | D-pad left |   7 |
| Right don (center) | Circle     |  13 |

Dedicated start and select buttons are also present. Unlike Pop'n Controllers,
no additional buttons are hardcoded to be always pressed.<br/>



## Controllers - Densha de Go! / Jet de Go! Controllers
Controllers used for Taito's Densha de Go! and Jet de Go! series. Unknown what
method is being used by Densha de Go! and Jet de Go! games for detecting these
controllers.

- The workings of Densha de Go! PSX controllers have been extensively researched
  in the [ddgo-controller-docs](https://github.com/MarcRiera/ddgo-controller-docs)
  repo.
- The Jet de Go! PSX controller comes in gray and black color. It seems to work
  the same as an analog controller and supports vibration. The steering wheel is
  mapped to the left stick (wheel rotation as horizontal, wheel raise/lower as
  vertical axis). The thrust throttle seems mapped to the right stick Y-axis
  full range (so half throttle matches vertically centered right stick).



##   Controllers - Fishing Controllers
The fishing rods are (next to lightguns) some of the more openly martial
playstation controllers - using the credo that "as long as you aren't using
dynamite: it's okay to kill them cause they don't have any feelings."<br/>

#### Logos on CD Covers
US Fishing games should have a "SLUH-00063" logo. European Fishing games don't
have any fishing logos; apparently fishing controllers haven't been officially
released/supported in Europe.<br/>
Japanese Fishing games can have a bunch of logos: Usually BANC-0001 or
SLPH-00100 (or both).<br/>
Moreover, some japanese games have a yellow/green fishing logo with japanese
text (found on Perfect Fishing: Bass Fishing, Perfect Fishing: Rock Fishing,
Simple 1500 Series Vol. 29: The Tsuri, Super Bass Fishing) (unknown if that
logo refer to other special hardware, or if it means the "normal" BANC-0001 or
SLPH-00100 controllers.<br/>
And Moreover, some japanese games have some sort of "headset" logos with
japanese text, these seem to have same meaning as SLPH-00100; as indicated by
photos on CD cover of Tsuwadou Keiryuu Mizuumihen (Best Edition) (2000); that
CD cover also has a "headset 2" logo, which seems to mean a newer PS2 variant
of the SLPH-00100.<br/>

#### PSX Fishing Controllers
```
  ASCII Tsuricon SLPH-00100 (also marked with a second serial, ASC-0514TR, on the packaging box)
  ASCII Tsuricon 2 ASC-0521TR2 (has a mode switch with 3 settings. "1" is original Tsuricon mode, "2" is Tsuricon 2 mode. Unknown what the unnumbered mode does)
  Sammy Tsuricon 2 SMY-0506FS (looks to be identical to the ASCII Tsuricon 2)
  Sammy Tsuricon 2+ SMY-0511FS (unknown what the differences between this and the Tsuricon 2 are)
  Agetec Bass Landing Fishing Controller SLUH-00063 (US version of ASCII's SLPH-00100 controller)
  Bandai Fishing Controller BANC-0001 (dark gray/blue) (has less buttons than ASCII/agetec)
  Interact Fission (light gray/blue)(similar to ASCII/agetec, 2 extra buttons?)
  Naki (transparent blue) (looks like a clone of the ASCII/agetec controllers)
  Hori HPS-97/HPS-98 (black/gray) (a fishing rod attached to a plastic fish)
```
Of these, the ASCII/agetec controllers seem to be most popular (and most
commonly supported). The Bandai contoller is also supported by a couple of
games (though the Bandai controller itself seems to be quite rare). The
Interact/Naki controllers are probably just clones of the ASCII/agetec ones.
The Hori controller is quite rare (and with its string and plastic fish, it's
apparently working completely different than the other fishing controllers).<br/>

#### Tech Info (all unknown)
Unknown how to detect fishing controllers.<br/>
Unknown how to read buttons, joystick, crank, motion sensors.<br/>
Unknown how to control rumble/vibration.<br/>
Unknown if/how Bandai differs from ASCII/agetec (aside from less buttons).<br/>
Unknown how the Hori thing works.<br/>

##   Controllers - PS2 DVD Remote
An accessory released by Sony for the PS2, consisting of an infrared remote
control and a receiver dongle that plugs into a controller port. The remote
features all standard controller buttons (including L3/R3) as well as additional
controls for the PS2's DVD player.<br/>
The receiver behaves very differently from any other known device: it does not
respond to any command until a button on the remote is pressed. When a valid IR
code is received it will start accepting commands for about 2000-2500 ms, then
become unresponsive again. It will initially behave as two different devices,
one with address 01h acting like a standard digital controller and the other
with address 61h exposing IR codes as received from the remote.<br/>

#### Command 04h - IR poll (and disable controller mode)
```
  Send Reply Comment
  61h  N/A   IR receiver address
  04h  12h   Receive ID bits 0-7, send command byte
  00h  5Ah   Receive ID bits 8-15
  00h  len   Receive code length (20 for DVD remote, 0 if no button is pressed)
  00h  code  Receive code bits 16-23
  00h  code  Receive code bits 8-15
  00h  code  Receive code bits 0-7
```
Returns the IR code of the currently pressed button and its length in bits, or
000000h if no button is pressed (and the receiver is still responding to
commands). Received codes seem to "stick around" for some time even after the
button has been released; when a button is held down the remote resends its code
every 45 ms, so the receiver presumably keeps returning the same code for about
50 ms as a debouncing measure.<br/>
The code is returned LSB first and MSB aligned, i.e. it should be right-shifted
by (24 - len) bits to obtain the "raw" code as sent by the remote. For
instance:<br/>
```
  Code sent by remote (first bit after preamble to last bit):
    0000 0000 1011 1001 0010
  Code sent by remote (MSB to LSB):
    0100 1001 1101 0000 0000
  Data returned by receiver:
    code[16:23] = 01001001
    code[8:15]  = 11010000
    code[0:7]   = 0000xxxx ; xxxx = (24 - len) bits of padding (all zeroes)
  Reassembled MSB-aligned code (MSB to LSB):
    0100 1001 1101 0000 0000 xxxx
```
The receiver will stop acting like a digital controller and replying to address
01h after this command is sent for the first time. Command 06h can be used to
restore controller functionality (see below), unknown if there is also a
watchdog to automatically restore controller mode if no IR poll commands are
issued.<br/>

#### Command 06h, 03h - Re-enable controller mode
```
  Send Reply Comment
  61h  N/A   IR receiver address
  06h  12h   Receive ID bits 0-7, send command byte 1
  03h  5Ah   Receive ID bits 8-15, send command byte 2
  00h  ?     Receive unknown data, send padding
  00h  ?
  00h  ?
  00h  ?
```

#### Command 0Fh - Unknown
This command exists (the receiver will keep pulling /ACK low) but its purpose is
currently unknown. It could possibly be an alternate poll command that does not
disable controller mode.<br/>

#### IR code format
The DVD remote always emits 20-bit IR codes. The receiver does return the length
of the code, but it's unclear if it can receive codes with lengths other than 20
bits.<br/>
All non-controller buttons on the remote are arranged in an 8x16 button matrix,
shown below (transposed for readability):<br/>

| Col | Row 0  | Row 1    | Row 2  | Row 3    | Row 4 | Row 5   | Row 6    | Row 7 |
| --: | :----- | :------- | :----- | :------- | :---- | :------ | :------- | :---- |

|   1 | 2      |          |        | Next     |       |         | Slow >>  |       |
|   2 | 3      |          |        | Play     |       |         |          |       |
|   3 | 4      |          |        | Scan <<  |       |         | Subtitle |       |
|   4 | 5      |          |        | Scan >>  |       | Display | Audio    |       |
|   5 | 6      |          |        | Shuffle  |       |         | Angle    |       |
|   6 | 7      |          |        |          |       |         |          |       |
|   7 | 8      |          |        |          |       |         |          |       |
|   8 | 9      |          | Time   | Stop     |       |         |          |       |
|   9 | 0      |          |        | Pause    |       |         |          | Up    |
|  10 |        | Title    | A<->B  |          |       |         |          | Down  |
|  11 | Enter  | DVD Menu |        |          |       |         |          | Left  |
|  12 |        |          | Repeat |          |       |         |          | Right |
|  13 |        |          |        |          |       |         |          |       |
|  14 | Return |          |        |          |       |         |          |       |
|  15 | Clear  | Program  |        |          |       |         |          |       |

Each button in the matrix is assigned a code as follows:<br/>
```
  code = 49D00h OR (row << 4) OR (column) ; sent LSB first

  ; where row = 0..7, column = 0..15
```
Controller buttons are handled separately and assigned different codes:<br/>
```
  code = DAD50h OR (id) ; sent LSB first

  ; where id = 0..15, index of the bit that would normally represent the button
  ; in the bitfield returned by a controller poll command
  ; (i.e. 0=Select, 1=L3, 2=R3, 3=Start, 4=Up, 5=Right, etc.)
```
Arrow buttons are a special case, as they are controller buttons but also have
matrix codes assigned. For those the remote alternates between both codes (see
below).<br/>

#### Low-level IR protocol
The remote emits IR pulses modulated with a 38 kHz carrier, as most remotes do.
Codes are sent as a 2460 µs "preamble" pulse followed by 24 data pulses, each of
which can be either 1250 µs (if the respective bit is 1) or 650 µs (if the
respective bit is 0) long. After each pulse including the preamble, the remote
waits 530 µs before sending the next pulse.<br/>
Every code is always sent at least 3 times in a row (more if the button is held
down but not necessarily a multiple of 3), approximately every 45 ms. For arrow
buttons the matrix code is sent 3 times first, then the respective controller
button code is sent 3 times, then the sequence repeats until the button is
released (with the total number of codes sent always being a multiple of 6 in
this case).<br/>

#### Built-in IR receivers
In later PS2 models, Sony integrated the IR receiver into the console. Assuming
the built-in receivers used the same circuitry as the external dongle, this may
explain its weird behavior: the receiver was likely designed to be wired in
parallel with one of the controller ports, and to be unresponsive until the
remote is actually in use to avoid interfering with another controller plugged
into the same port. Whether or not the integrated receivers are connected this
way has not been confirmed.<br/>
There is a second revision of the DVD remote with power and eject buttons, meant
to be used with the PS2 models that have a built-in receiver. Weirdly enough,
however, it seems to be incompatible with the older receiver dongle.<br/>

##   Controllers - I-Mode Adaptor (Mobile Internet)
The I-Mode Adaptor cable (SCPH-10180) allows to connect an I-mode compatible
mobile phone to the playstation's controller port; granting a mobile internet
connection to japanese games.<br/>

#### PSX Games for I-Mode Adaptor (Japan only)
```
  Doko Demo Issyo (PlayStation the Best release only) (Sony) 2000
  Doko Demo Issyo Deluxe Pack (Bomber eXpress/Sony) 2001
  Hamster Club-I (SLPS-03266) (Jorudan) 2002
  iMode mo Issyo: Dokodemo Issho Tsuika Disc (Bomber/Sony) 2001
  Keitai Eddy (iPC) 2000 (but, phone connects to SIO port on REAR side of PSX?)
  Komocchi (Victor) 2001
  Mobile Tomodachi (Hamster) 2002
  Motto Trump Shiyouyo! i-Mode de Grand Prix (Pure Sound) 2002
  One Piece Mansion (Capcom) 2001 (japanese version only)
```
The supported games should have a I-Mode adaptor logo on the CD cover (the logo
depicts two plugs: the PSX controller plug, and the smaller I-Mode plug).<br/>
Note: "Dragon Quest Monsters 1 & 2" was announced/rumoured to support
I-mode (however, its CD cover doesn't show any I-Mode adapter logo).<br/>

#### Tech Details (all unknown)
Unknown how to detect the thing, and how to do the actual data transfers.<br/>
The cable does contain a 64pin chip, an oscillator, and some smaller components
(inside of the PSX controller port connector).<br/>

#### Hardware Variant
Keitai Eddy seems to have the phone connect to the SIO port (on rear side of
the PSX, at least it's depicted like so on the CD cover). This is apparently
something different than the SCPH-10180 controller-port cable. Unknown what it
is exactly - probably some mobile internet connection too, maybe also using
I-mode, or maybe some other protocol.<br/>



##   Controllers - Keyboards
There isn't any official retail keyboard for PSX, however, there is a shitload
of obscure ways to connect keyboards...<br/>

#### Sony SCPH-2000 PS/2 Keyboard/Mouse Adaptor (prototype/with cable) (undated)
#### Sony SCPH-2000 PS/2 Keyboard/Mouse Adaptor (without cable) (undated)
A PS/2 to PSX controller port adaptor. Maybe for educational Lightspan titles?<br/>
There are two hardware variants of the adaptor:<br/>
```
  Adaptor with short cable to PSX-controller port (and prototype marking)
  Adaptor without cable, directly plugged into controller port (final version?)
```
Unknown ^how to access those adaptors, and unknown if the two versions differ
at software side. There seem to be not much more than a handful of people
owning that adaptors, and none of them seems to know how to use it, or even how
to test if it's working with existing software...<br/>
- Keyboard reading might work with the Online Connection CD.<br/>
- Mouse reading might work with normal mouse compatible PSX games.<br/>

#### Lightspan Online Connection CD Keyboard (1997)
The Online Connection CD is a web browser from the educational Lightspan
series, the CD is extremly rare (there's only one known copy of the disc).<br/>
The thing requires a dial-up modem connected to the serial port (maybe simply
using the same RS232 adaptor as used by Yaroze). User input can be done via
joypad, or optionally, via some external keyboard (or keyboard adaptor)
hardware:<br/>
```
  Send  01h 42h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 00h 06h
  Reply HiZ 96h 5Ah num dat dat dat dat dat dat dat dat dat dat dat
```
The num byte indicates number of following scancodes (can be num=FFh, maybe
when no keyboard connected?, or num=00h..0Bh for max 11 bytes, unless the last
some bytes should have other meaning, like status/mouse data or so).<br/>
The keyboard scancodes are in "PS/2 Keyboard Scan Code Set 2" format.<br/>
The binary contains some (unused) code for sending data to the keyboard by
changing the 4th-11th byte, and resuming normal operation by setting 4th and
11th byte back to zero:<br/>
```
  Send  ..  ..  ..  01h xxh FFh FFh FFh FFh FFh 00h ..  ..  ..  ..
  Send  ..  ..  ..  00h ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  00h ..  ..  ..  ..
```
Maybe 4th and 11th byte are number of following bytes, with xxh being some
command, and FFh's just being bogus padding; the xxh looks more like an
incrementing value though.<br/>
Despite of the mouse-based GUI, the browser software doesn't seem to support
mouse hardware (neither via PS/2 mice, nor PSX mice). Instead, the mouse arrow
can be merely moved via joypad's DPAD, or (in a very clumsy fashion) via
keyboard cursor keys.<br/>
Note: The browser uses SysEnqIntRP to install some weird IRQ handler that
forcefully aborts all controller (or memory card) transfers upon Vblank.
Unknown if that's somehow required to bypass bugs in the keyboard hardware. The
feature is kinda dangerous for memory card access (especially with fast memcard
access in nocash kernel, which allows to transfer more than one sector per
frame).<br/>

#### Spectrum Emulator Keyboard & Sega Sticks Adaptor (v2/controller port) (2000)
Made by Anthony Ball. [http://www.sinistersoft.com/psxkeyboard]

This adaptor can send pad/stick data,<br/>
```
  Send  01h 42h 00h  0h 0h

The above mode(s) can be switched via ACPI Power/Sleep/Wake keys (on keyboards
that do have such keys).<br/>
```

  4  EMUA            ; emulation mode a
  5  EMUB            ; emulation mode b
```
For whatever reason, the PS/2 scancodes are translated to ASCII-style scancode
values (with bit7=KeyUp flag):<br/>
```
  01   11 12 13 14  15 16 17 18  19 1A 1B 1C  1D 69 1F
  60 21 22 68 24 25 5E 26 2A 28 29 5F 3D  2D  0B 0E 0F  67 2F 1E 2D

```
BUG: The thing conflicts with memory cards: It responds to ANY byte with value
01h (it should do so only if the FIRST byte is 01h).<br/>

#### Homebrew PS/2 Keyboard/Mouse Adaptor (undated/from PSone era)

```
Made by Simon Armstrong. This thing emulates a standard PSX Mouse (and should
thus work with most or all mouse compatible games). Additionally, it's sending
keyboard flags/scancodes via unused mouse button bits.<br/>

#### Runix hardware add-on USB Keyboard/Mouse Adaptor (2001) (PIO extension port)
Runix is a homebrew linux kernel for PSX, it can be considered being the holy
grail of the open source scene because nobody has successfully compiled it in
the past 16 years.<br/>
- USB host controller SL811H driver with keyboard and mouse support;<br/>
- RTC support.<br/>
file: drivers/usb/sl811h.c<br/>

#### TTY Console
The PSX kernel allows to output "printf" debug messages via stdout. In the
opposite direction, it's supporting to receive ASCII user input via
"std\_in\_gets" (there isn't any software actually using that feature though,
except maybe debug consoles like DTL-H2000).<br/>



##   Controllers - Additional Inputs
#### Reset Button
PSX only (not PSone). Reboots the PSX via /RESET signal. Probably including for
forcefully getting through the WHOLE BIOS Intro, making it rather
useless/annoying? No idea if it clears ALL memory during reboot?<br/>

#### CDROM Shell Open
Status bit of the CDROM controller. Can be used to sense if the shell is opened
(and also memorizes if the shell was opened since last check; allowing to sense
possible disk changes).<br/>

#### PocketStation
Memory Card with built-in LCD screen and Buttons (which can be used as
miniature handheld console). However, when it is connected to the PSX, the
buttons are vanishing in the cartridge slot, so the buttons cannot be used as
additional inputs for PSX games.<br/>

#### Serial Port PSX only (not PSone)
With an external adaptor (voltage conversion), the serial port can be used
(among others) to connect a RS232 Serial Mouse. Although, most or all
commercial games with mouse input are probably (?) supporting only Sony's Mouse
(on the controller port) (rather than standard RS232 devices on the serial
port).<br/>

#### TTY Debug Terminal
If present, the external DUART can be used for external keyboard input, at the
BIOS side, this is supported as "std\_in".<br/>

```
 The thumb buttons on the left act as L1 and R1,
    the trigger is L2, the pinky button is R2
 The thumb buttons on the right act as X and O,
    the trigger is Square and the pinky button is Triangle.
 I find this odd as the triggers should've been L1 and R1,
    the pinkies L2 and R2.
 The buttons are redundantly placed on the base as large buttons like what
    you'd see on a fight/arcade stick. Also with Start and Select.
 There is also a physical analog mode switch,
    not a button like on dual shock.
```

#### MX4SIO
The MX4SIO is a homebrew microSD card adapter for the PS2 that plugs into a
memory card slot, taking advantage of the fact that SD cards support an SPI mode
which is more or less compatible with SIO0. The adapter is completely passive
and has the card wired up as follows:<br/>

| uSD pin | Name         | Wired to MC pin |
| ------: | :----------- | :-------------- |
|       1 | `D2`/`NC`    | -               |
|       2 | `D3`/`/CS`   | `/CS`           |
|       3 | `CMD`/`MOSI` | `CMD`/`MOSI`    |
|       4 | `VCC`        | `+3.5V`         |
|       5 | `SCK`        | `SCK`           |
|       6 | `GND`        | `GND`, `/ACK`   |
|       7 | `D0`/`MISO`  | `DAT`/`MISO`    |
|       8 | `D1`/`NC`    | -               |

Unfortunately, this design has a fatal flaw that makes it unusable as-is on the
PS1: /ACK is permanently shorted to ground, taking down the entire controller
bus. However, it should be possible to use the MX4SIO on a PS1 with custom
driver code once the MX4SIO's /ACK pin is masked out with some tape, or if no
other controllers or memory cards are plugged in.<br/>
Note that, as SD cards do not employ the addressing scheme used by standard
controllers and memory cards, the MX4SIO should get its own dedicated /CSn pin
and not share the port with a controller (i.e. if the MX4SIO is plugged in slot
2, then controller port 2 shall be left unused).<br/>

##   Memory Card Read/Write Commands
#### Reading Data from Memory Card
```
  Send Reply Comment
  81h  N/A   Memory card address
  52h  FLAG  Send Read Command (ASCII "R"), Receive FLAG Byte
  00h  5Ah   Receive Memory Card ID1
  00h  5Dh   Receive Memory Card ID2
  MSB  (00h) Send Address MSB  ;\sector number (0..3FFh)
  LSB  (pre) Send Address LSB  ;/
  00h  5Ch   Receive Command Acknowledge 1  ;<-- late /ACK after this byte-pair
  00h  5Dh   Receive Command Acknowledge 2
  00h  MSB   Receive Confirmed Address MSB
  00h  LSB   Receive Confirmed Address LSB
  00h  ...   Receive Data Sector (128 bytes)
  00h  CHK   Receive Checksum (MSB xor LSB xor Data bytes)
  00h  47h   Receive Memory End Byte (should be always 47h="G"=Good for Read)
```
Non-sony cards additionally send eight 5Ch bytes after the end flag.<br/>
When sending an invalid sector number, original Sony memory cards respond with
FFFFh as Confirmed Address (and do then abort the transfer without sending any
data, checksum, or end flag), third-party memory cards typically respond with
the sector number ANDed with 3FFh (and transfer the data for that adjusted
sector number).<br/>

```
This command is supported only by original Sony memory cards. Not sure if all
sony cards are responding with the same values, and what meaning they have,
might be number of sectors (0400h) and sector size (0080h) or whatever.<br/>

#### Invalid Commands
```
  Send Reply Comment
  81h  N/A   Memory card address
  xxh  FLAG  Send Invalid Command (anything else than "R", "W", or "S")
```
Transfer aborts immediately after the faulty command byte, or, occasionally
after one more byte (with response FFh to that extra byte).<br/>

#### FLAG Byte
The initial value of the FLAG byte on power-up (and when re-inserting the
memory card) is 08h.<br/>
Bit3=1 is indicating that the directory wasn't read yet (allowing to sense
memory card changes). For some strange reason, bit3 is NOT reset when reading
from the card, but rather when writing to it. To reset the flag, games are
usually issuing a dummy write to sector number 003Fh, more or less
unneccessarily stressing the lifetime of that sector.<br/>
Bit2=1 seems to be intended to indicate write errors, however, the write
command seems to be always finishing without setting that bit, instead, the
error flag may get set on the NEXT command.<br/>
Note: Some (not all) non-sony cards also have Bit5 of the FLAG byte set.<br/>

#### Timings
IRQ7 is usually triggered circa 1500 cycles after sending a byte (counted from
the begin of the first bit), except, the last byte doesn't trigger IRQ7, and,
after the 7th byte of the Read command, an additional delay of circa 31000
cycles occurs before IRQ7 gets triggered (that strange extra delay occurs only
on original Sony cards, not on cards from other manufacturers).<br/>
There seems to be no extra delays in the Write command, as it seems, the data
is written on the fly, and one doesn't need to do any write-busy handling...
although, theoretically, the write shouldn't start until verifying the
checksum... so it can't be done on the fly at all...?<br/>

#### Notes
Responses in brackets are don't care, (00h) means usually zero, (pre) means
usually equal to the previous command byte (eg. the response to LSB is MSB).<br/>

Memory cards are reportedly "Flash RAM" which sounds like bullshit, might be
battery backed SRAM, or FRAM, or slower EEPROM or FLASH ROM, or vary from card
to card...?<br/>



##   Memory Card Data Format
#### Data Size
```
  Total Memory 128KB = 131072 bytes = 20000h bytes
  1 Block 8KB = 8192 bytes = 2000h bytes
  1 Frame 128 bytes = 80h bytes
```
The memory is split into 16 blocks (of 8 Kbytes each), and each block is split
into 64 sectors (of 128 bytes each). The first block is used as Directory, the
remaining 15 blocks are containing Files, each file can occupy one or more
blocks.<br/>

#### Header Frame (Block 0, Frame 0)
```
  00h-01h Memory Card ID (ASCII "MC")
  02h-7Eh Unused (zero)
  7Fh     Checksum (all above bytes XORed with each other) (usually 0Eh)
```

#### Directory Frames (Block 0, Frame 1..15)
```
  00h-03h Block Allocation State
            00000051h - In use ;first-or-only block of a file
            00000052h - In use ;middle block of a file (if 3 or more blocks)
            00000053h - In use ;last block of a file   (if 2 or more blocks)
            000000A0h - Free   ;freshly formatted
            000000A1h - Free   ;deleted (first-or-only block of file)
            000000A2h - Free   ;deleted (middle block of file)
            000000A3h - Free   ;deleted (last block of file)
  04h-07h Filesize in bytes (2000h..1E000h; in multiples of 8Kbytes)
  08h-09h Pointer to the NEXT block number (minus 1) used by the file
            (ie. 0..14 for Block Number 1..15) (or FFFFh if last-or-only block)
  0Ah-1Eh Filename in ASCII, terminated by 00h (max 20 chars, plus ending 00h)
  1Fh     Zero (unused)
  20h-7Eh Garbage (usually 00h-filled)
  7Fh     Checksum (all above bytes XORed with each other)
```
Filesize [04h..07h] and Filename [0Ah..1Eh] are stored only in the first
directory entry of a file (ie. with State=51h or A1h), other directory entries
have that bytes zero-filled.<br/>

#### Filename Notes
The first some letters of the filename should indicate the game to which the
file belongs, in case of commercial games this is conventionally done like so:
Two character region code:<br/>
```
  "BI"=Japan, "BE"=Europe, "BA"=America
```
followed by 10 character game code,<br/>
```
  in "AAAA-NNNNN" form     ;for Pocketstation executables replace "-" by "P"
```
where the "AAAA" part does imply the region too; (SLPS/SCPS=Japan,
SLUS/SCUS=America, SLES/SCES=Europe) (SCxS=Made by Sony, SLxS=Licensed by
Sony), followed by up to 8 characters,<br/>
```
  "abcdefgh"
```
(which may identify the file if the game uses multiple files; this part often
contains a random string which seems to be allowed to contain any chars in
range of 20h..7Fh, of course it shouldn't contain "?" and "\*" wildcards).<br/>

#### Broken Sector List (Block 0, Frame 16..35)
```
  00h-03h Broken Sector Number (Block*64+Frame) (FFFFFFFFh=None)
  04h-7Eh Garbage (usually 00h-filled) (some cards have [08h..09h]=FFFFh)
  7Fh     Checksum (all above bytes XORed with each other)
```
If Block0/Frame(16+N) indicates that a given sector is broken, then the data
for that sector is stored in Block0/Frame(36+N).<br/>

#### Broken Sector Replacement Data (Block 0, Frame 36..55)
```
  00h-7Fh Data (usually FFh-filled, if there's no broken sector)
```

#### Unused Frames (Block 0, Frame 56..62)
```
  00h-7Fh Unused (usually FFh-filled)
```

#### Write Test Frame (Block 0, Frame 63)
Reportedly "write test". Usually same as Block 0 ("MC", 253 zero-bytes, plus
checksum 0Eh).<br/>

#### Title Frame (Block 1..15, Frame 0) (in first block of file only)
```
  00h-01h  ID (ASCII "SC")
  02h      Icon Display Flag
             11h...Icon has 1 frame  (static) (same image shown forever)
             12h...Icon has 2 frames (animated) (changes every 16 PAL frames)
             13h...Icon has 3 frames (animated) (changes every 11 PAL frames)
            Values other than 11h..13h seem to be treated as corrupted file
            (causing the file not to be listed in the bootmenu)
  03h      Block Number (1-15)  "icon block count"  Uh?
                   (usually 01h or 02h... might be block number within
                   files that occupy 2 or more blocks)
                   (actually, that kind of files seem to HAVE title frames
                   in ALL of their blocks; not only in their FIRST block)
                   (at least SOME seem to have such duplicated title frame,
                   but not all?)
  04h-43h  Title in Shift-JIS format (64 bytes = max 32 characters)
  44h-4Fh  Reserved (00h)
  50h-5Fh  Reserved (00h)  ;<-- this region is used for the Pocketstation
  60h-7Fh  Icon 16 Color Palette Data (each entry is 16bit CLUT)
```
For more info on entries [50h..5Fh], see<br/>
[Pocketstation File Header/Icons](pocketstation.md#pocketstation-file-headericons)<br/>

#### Icon Frame(s) (Block 1..15, Frame 1..3) (in first block of file only)
```
  00h-7Fh  Icon Bitmap (16x16 pixels, 4bit color depth)
```
Note: The icons are shown in the BIOS bootmenu (which appears when starting the
PlayStation without a CDROM inserted). The icons are drawn via GP0(2Ch)
command, ie. as Textured four-point polygon, opaque, with texture-blending,
whereas the 24bit blending color is 808080h (so it's quite the same as raw
texture without blending). As semi-transparency is disabled, Palette/CLUT
values can be 0000h=FullyTransparent, or 8000h=SolidBlack (the icons are
usually shown on a black background, so it doesn't make much of a difference).<br/>

#### Data Frame(s) (Block 1..15, Frame N..63; N=excluding any Title/Icon Frames)
```
  00h-7Fh  Data
```
Note: Files that occupy more than one block are having only ONE Title area, and
only one Icon area (in the first sector(s) of their first block), the
additional blocks are using sectors 0..63 for plain data.<br/>

#### Shift-JIS Character Set (16bit) (used in Title Frames)
Can contain japanese or english text, english characters are encoded like so:<br/>
```
  81h,40h      --> SPC
  81h,43h..97h --> punctuation marks
  82h,4Fh..58h --> "0..9"
  82h,60h..79h --> "A..Z"
  82h,81h..9Ah --> "a..z"
```
Titles shorter than 32 characters are padded with 00h-bytes.<br/>
Note: The titles are \<usually\> in 16bit format (even if they consist of
raw english text), however, the BIOS memory card manager does also accept 8bit
characters 20h..7Fh (so, in the 8bit form, the title could be theoretically up
to 64 characters long, but, nethertheless, the BIOS displays only max 32
chars).<br/>
For displaying Titles, the BIOS includes a complete Shift-JIS character set,<br/>
[BIOS Character Sets](kernelbios.md#bios-character-sets)<br/>
Shift-JIS is focused on asian languages, and does NOT include european letters
(eg. such with accent marks). Although the non-japanese PSX BIOSes DO include a
european character set, the BIOS memory card manager DOESN'T seem to translate
any title character codes to that character set region.<br/>



##   Memory Card Images
There are a lot of different ways to get a save from a memory card onto your
PC's hard disk, and these ways sometimes involve sticking some additional
information into a header at the beginning of the file.<br/>

#### Raw Memory Card Images (without header) (ie. usually 128K in size)
```
  SmartLink .PSM,
  WinPSM .PS,
  DataDeck .DDF,
  FPSX .MCR,
  ePSXe .MCD...
```
don't stick any header on the data at all, so you can just read it in and treat
it like a raw memory card.<br/>

All of these headers contain a signature at the top of the file. The three most
common formats and their signatures are:<br/>

```
     Connectix Virtual Game Station format (.MEM): "VgsM", 64 bytes
     PlayStation Magazine format (.PSX): "PSV", 256 bytes
```

some programs will OMIT any blank or unallocated blocks from the end of the
memory card -- if only three save blocks on the card are in use, for example,
saving the other twelve is pointless.<br/>

#### Xploder and Action Replay Files (54 byte header)
```
  00h..14h Filename in ASCII, terminated by 00h (max 20 chars, plus ending 00h)
  15h..35h Title in ASCII, terminated by 00h (max 32 chars, plus ending 00h)
  36h..    File Block(s) (starting with the Title sector)
```
This format contains only a single file (not a whole memory card). The filename
should be the same as used in the Memory Card Directory. The title is more or
less don't care; it may be the SHIFT-JIS title from the Title Sector converted
to ASCII.<br/>

#### .MCS Files (Single Save Format)
MCS files consist of the 128 byte directory frame for the savefile's first block followed by all of that savefile's blocks in linked list order. When importing this format, the directory frame should be parsed for the save filename and the filesize while other fields should be ignored. The rest of the directory frame fields and any extra directory frames, in the case of multi-block saves, should be reconstructed based on the destination memory card.

#### .GME Files (usually 20F40h bytes)
InterAct GME format, produced by the DexDrive.<br/>
```
  000h 12   ASCII String "123-456-STD",00h
  00Ch 4    Usually zerofilled (or meaningless garbage in some files)
  010h 5    Always 00h,00h,01h,00h,01h
  015h 16   Copy of Sector 0..15 byte[00h] ;"M", followed by allocation states
  025h 16   Copy of Sector 0..15 byte[08h] ;00h, followed by next block values
  035h 11   Usually zerofilled (or meaningless garbage in some files)
  040h F00h Fifteen Description Strings (each one 100h bytes, padded with 00h)
  F40h 128K Memory Card Image (128K) (unused sectors 00h or FFh filled)
```
This is a very strange file format, no idea where it comes from. It contains a
F40h bytes header (mainly zerofilled), followed by the whole 128K of FLASH
memory (mainly zerofilled, too, since it usually contains only a small single
executable file).<br/>



##   Memory Card Notes
#### Sony PSX Memory Cards
Sony has manufactured only 128KByte memory cards for PSX, no bigger/smaller
ones.<br/>

#### Sony PS2 Memory Cards
A special case would be PS2 cards, these are bigger, but PS2 cards won't fit
into PSX cards slots (unless when cutting an extra notch in the card edge
connector), a PSX game played on a PS2 console could theoretically access PS2
cards (if it supports the different directory structure on that cards).<br/>

#### Third Party Cards with bigger capacity
Some third party cards contain larger memory chips, however, the PSX
games/kernel are supporting only regular 128Kbyte cards, so the extra memory
can be used only by dividing it into several 128Kbyte memory card images.<br/>
Selecting a different memory card image can be done by a switch or button on
the card, or via joypad key combinations (joypad/card are sharing the same
signals, so the card could watch the traffic on joypad bus, provided that the
MIPS CPU is actually reading the joypad).<br/>

#### Third Party Cards with bigger capacity and Data Compression
Some cards are additionally using data compression to increase the card
capacity, but that techinque is having rather bad reputation and could result
in data loss. For example, if a game has allocated four blocks on the memory
card, then it'll expect to be able to overwrite that four blocks at any time
(without needing to handle "memory card full" errors), however, if the card is
full, and if the newly written data has worse compression ratio, then the card
will be unable to store the new game position (and may have already overwritten
parts of the old game position). As a workaround, such cards may use a LED to
warn users when running low on memory (ideally, there should be always at least
128Kbytes of free memory).<br/>

#### Joytech Smart Card Adaptor
The smart card adaptor plugs into memory card slot, and allows to use special
credit card-shaped memory cards. There don't seem to be any special features,
ie. the hardware setup does just behave like normal PSX memory cards.<br/>

#### Datel VMEM (virtual memory card storage on expansion port)
The Datel/Interact VMEM exists as standalone VMEM cartridge, and some Datel
Cheat Devices do also include the VMEM feature. Either way, the VMEM connects
to expansion port, and contain some large FLASH memory, for storing multiple
memory cards on it. Unknown, how that memory is accessed (maybe it must be
copied to a regular memory card, or maybe they've somehow hooked the Kernel (or
even the hardware signals?) so that games could directly access the VMEM?<br/>

#### Passwords (instead of Memory Cards)
Some older games are using passwords instead of memory cards to allow the user
to continue at certain game positions. That's nice for people without memory
card, but unfortunately many of that games are restricted to it - it'd be more
user friendly to support both passwords, and, optionally, memory cards.<br/>

#### Yaroze Access Cards (DTL-H3020)
The Yaroze Access Card connects to memory card slot, the card resembles regular
memory cards, but it doesn't contain any storage memory. Instead, it does
merely support a very basic Access Card detection command:<br/>
```
  Send Reply Comment
  21h  N/A?  Probably replies HighZ (ie. probably reads FFh)?
  53h  0xh?  Replies unknown 8bit value (upper 4bit are known to be zero)?
```
Ie. when receiving 21h as first byte, it replies by an ACK, and does then
output 0xh as response to the next byte.<br/>
Without the Access Card, the Yaroze Bootdisc will refuse to work (the disc
contains software for transferring data to/from PC, for developing homebrew
games).<br/>
